<!-- JavaScript render blocking:  we load JavaScript right away, the HTML will parse until it encounters a reference to a JavaScript, then the JavaScript file is loaded, executed and then we continue the HTML parsing. -->

<!-- Load JavaScript file asynchronously using ASYNC ATTRIBUTE: the file will be downloaded alongside the HTML and render blocking only kicks in when the script is executed. -->

<!-- If we defer the script, loading and execution of the file, even if it's referenced in the head, only happens when everything else is loaded.  -->
